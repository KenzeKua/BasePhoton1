# BasePhoton1
Base C++ project with Photon Engine and OpenGL. Doesn't include base cpp to use OpenGL.  

This is the base C++ project provided by the lecturer of Data Communication & Networking in KDU.  

This project only provides the base files for using Photon Engine. Although the OpenGL SDK is used, there are no base files to utilize it.
